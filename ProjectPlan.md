- Project Plan: https://github.com/VD-25/osiris-admin-portal/blob/main/ProjectPlan.md
- Kanban Board to keep track of *to-do*, *in-progress*, and *done* tasks: https://github.com/users/VD-25/projects/3

Steps for each API: APIs are to be written in Node.js with starting base repo:
  - Team member needs to clone repo and and `npm init` a Node.js project
  - Set up `index.js` with an Express server (similar to microservice API exercise) etc and commit/push it back to the repo
  - Everyone then clones the now Node.js init'd repo to their machines and creates can code their APIs (1 file per API preferably)


Additionally, we created a ruleset stating that each PR needs to be reviewed by at least 1 member before it can be merged. We have also created a *Task*, *Bug*, and *Documentation* template issue for future reference.
